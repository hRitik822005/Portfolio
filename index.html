            Hi! I'm Khilesh Dewangan, a passionate front-end or full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love building responsive, user-friendly web applications and turning ideas into interactive digital <br><br>

            I enjoy learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills. Recently, I built a Currency Calculator that helps users convert currencies easily with real-time rates.<br><br>

            I'm currently looking for opportunities to work on exciting web projects and grow as a developer.<br><br>

            When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new tech trends, reading about web development, or working on personal projects to enhance my skills.<br><br>

            I am a passionate web developer with a keen interest in creating interactive and user-friendly web applications. My journey in web development has been driven by a desire to learn and innovate, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.
        </p>

                Personal Interests
            </h3>
            <p class="about-text">
                Beyond my passion for web development, I'm deeply interested in continuous learning and personal growth. I'm an enthusiastic reader, especially drawn to books on self-development, finance, psychology, and entrepreneurship. I believe that reading sharpens my perspective and helps me stay curious and informed.<br><br>

                I'm actively gaining knowledge in personal finance, the stock market, and real estate investing. These fields fascinate me because they not only influence personal success but also offer long-term freedom and stability. I enjoy analyzing market trends, understanding investment strategies, and learning how smart financial decisions can shape a better future.<br><br>

                My interest in real estate goes beyond just theory — I'm fascinated by how properties appreciate, how to evaluate deals, and how real estate can be a powerful tool for wealth-building. Similarly, I enjoy tracking the stock market, studying company fundamentals, and understanding the psychology of investing.<br><br>

                For me, combining technical skills with financial literacy creates a well-rounded mindset — one that's creative, strategic, and future-focused.
